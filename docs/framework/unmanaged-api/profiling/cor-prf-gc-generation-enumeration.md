# <a name="cor_prf_gc_generation-enumeration"></a>COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION 열거형
Identifies a garbage-collection generation.  
  
## <a name="syntax"></a>구문  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum {  
    COR_PRF_GC_GEN_0 = 0,  
    COR_PRF_GC_GEN_1 = 1,  
    COR_PRF_GC_GEN_2 = 2,  
    COR_PRF_GC_LARGE_OBJECT_HEAP = 3  
} COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION;  
```  
  
## <a name="members"></a>멤버  
  
|멤버|설명|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`COR_PRF_GC_GEN_0`|The object is stored as generation 0.|  
|`COR_PRF_GC_GEN_1`|The object is stored as generation 1.|  
|`COR_PRF_GC_GEN_2`|The object is stored as generation 2.|  
|`COR_PRF_GC_LARGE_OBJECT_HEAP`|The object is stored in the large-object heap.|  
  
## <a name="remarks"></a>주의  
 The garbage collector improves memory management performance by dividing objects into generations based on age. The garbage collector currently uses three generations, numbered 0, 1, and 2, plus a special heap segment that is used for large objects. Objects whose size is larger than a particular value are stored in the large-object heap. Other allocated objects start out belonging to generation 0. All objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 0 are promoted to generation 1. Objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 1 move into generation 2.  
  
 The use of generations means that the garbage collector has to work with only a subset of the allocated objects at any one time.  
  
 The `COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION` enumeration is used by the [COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION_RANGE](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-gc-generation-range-structure.md) structure.
